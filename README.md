Blog based on Django. Second Project to understand Django and Python

I have no clue what's going on, i am reading tutorials and doing it. Final Commit will be marked. If anything is remaining i will add it here. Basically, a simple blog, getting used to models, templates etc etc...
Hopefully will be done by mid night. 

Next project will be some basic ecom site. No Frontend (i don't think i can do anything complex yet) just backend. Will be finishing that project as soon as possible. Have to present the site to someone.
